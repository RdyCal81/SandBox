  From   : Randy A. Callaway
  Ref.   : Quote for Project UH102
  Date   : November 12, 1997

	This is a Quote for software development of the Project UH102.
	Because of the limited time I have to complete this project I will
	be working on it every night from now until completion,	November 20th.
	Due to the amount of time I will be spending on	the project I have
	risen the per hour rate from $55 to $65.  I hope this is acceptable
	in return for the quick development time.  When	you recieve this Quote
	I will also give Aaron the I/O port assignments	that we have agreed on.
	I will need these I/O assignments to remain the unchanged in order to
	meet the deadline.  I will be at UTI on Friday November 14th, the
	entire day to develope and test software, and Saturday if the need
	exists.  At some point before that I will need to discuss
	what the LCD screens are going to look like.  I will need feedback
	on the Software before November 14th in order to fix any bugs
	found.  During the week of November 17th to November 21st I will most
	likely be traveling to UTI often to do final bug fixes and any other
	modifications needed.
	
	I cannot stress enough the need for UTI to keep me informed as quickly
	as possible anything that needs to be added or modified on this
	project.  It will not take much of a delay to miss the November 21st
	deadline.
	
	I have broken down the tasks and hours into catagories as follows :

	 1 : KeyBoard, 5 screens at .5hrs		  2.5 hrs
	 2 : LCD, 5 screens at 3hrs			 15.0 hrs
	 3 : Running Operations, 6 at 4hrs		 24.0 hrs
	 4 : Math routines				  6.0 hrs
	 5 : HardWare to develope and test		 10.0 hrs
	 6 : Driving to/from Moorpark, meetings		 20.0 hrs

						total : 77.5 hrs
						@ $65 = $5,037.50
		Total quote : $5,000


	Assuming my progress is acceptable with the delivery of the first
	software, I would like 50% payment on Thursday November 20th, with
	the remainder on Friday November 28th.  As always, any problems
	found after full payment has been recieved will be fixed.

			Thank You,
